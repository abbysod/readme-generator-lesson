  ## Installation
  ${data.installation}

  ## Usage
  ${data.usage}
  
  
  List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
  
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
  
  If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
  
  ## License
  ${data.license}
  
  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to(https://choosealicense.com/)
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

  üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
  
  ## Badges
  ${data.badges}
  
  ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
  
  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  ${data.features}
  
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  ${data.contribution}
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  ${data.tests}
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application.
